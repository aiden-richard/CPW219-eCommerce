## How these are used
The Bookshop website is built using ASP.NET Core MVC. The website uses the Bootstrap library to provide an easy and quick way to style the site. The Bootstrap examples are very helpful for finding the styles you need quickly. The backend of the site interacts with the database using Entity Framework Core. It enables us to interact with the database using objects instead of writing raw queries. The jQuery library is included by default with MVC, it has not been used in this project yet.
